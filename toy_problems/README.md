# Toy problems

These scripts implement the experiments from the ICLR 2016 workshop paper
[Feed-Forward Networks with Attention Can Solve Some Long-Term Memory Problems]
(http://colinraffel.com/publications/iclr2016feed.pdf).
Simply run them with Python.

Requirements:

  - numpy
  - Theano >= 0.8
  - [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) (you probably need to install from source, not PIP)
  - [lstm_problems](https://github.com/craffel/lstm_problems)
